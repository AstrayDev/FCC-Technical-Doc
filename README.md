# FCC-Technical-Doc
This is my third FCC project, I feel like I learned a bit more in the process of making it but still definitely lost feeling.
If anything I learned to move things with css properties such as top, right, bottom, left with different position values.
I tried to make it mobile friendly with media quary selectors but uuuuh that only went so well, mostly just resized the font a bit.
But either way I think it looks fine...enough, definitley things that could have been done better but I tried and learned a few things so good enough for now.
Maybe oneday I'll come back and fix my past abominations.
